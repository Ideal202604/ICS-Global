## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ics-global-website.git
cd ics-global-website

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at **http://localhost:5173/**

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The optimised output will be in the `dist/` folder, ready to deploy on any static hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, AWS S3, etc.).

## 📧 EmailJS Setup

The contact form is powered by [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) for client-side email delivery. To activate it:

1. Create a free account at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Set up an email service and template
3. Update the placeholder IDs in `src/lib/emailjs.ts`:

```ts
export const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = "your_service_id";
export const EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = "your_template_id";
export const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = "your_public_key";
```

Template variables used: `from_name`, `from_email`, `phone`, `message`

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The site is fully responsive with three primary breakpoints:

- **Mobile** (< 768px) — single-column layouts, hamburger menu, touch-friendly spacing
- **Tablet** (768px – 1024px) — 2-column grids, adjusted typography
- **Desktop** (1024px+) — full multi-column layouts, pill navbar, side-by-side sections

Fluid scaling is achieved through `clamp()` values for font sizes, padding, and container heights — no abrupt jumps between breakpoints.
